About natural history, nomenclature, and taxonomy
- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr. Aaratrik Pal
- 👀 I’m broadly interested in the diversity of butterflies, damselflies, dragonflies, and their photography, diversity, taxonomy, nomenclature, and systemactis of flowering plants.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about local biodiversity around me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on odonata diversity and taxonomy, plant diversity, nomenclature, taxonomy and systematics.
